# Homework

1. Add fonts using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
2. Open file `style.css` and write basic styles for the marked-up blocks using Emmet.

      - text color
      - borders / border radius
      - list-style 
      - opacity

3. Optional: Connect [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) to your project as a separate file, use `<link>` tag in `<head>`.

## Criteria CSS

仇벒잺 **Single CSS File** <br />
Use a single CSS file for all pages (style.css). <br />
Normalize.css should be included as an additional file. 

仇벒잺 **All fonts used in the design are connected to the pages.** <br />
Preferably from Google Fonts. 

仇벒잺 **Provide fallback fonts and family types at the end of the font list.** 
For example:  ```font-family: Roboto, Arial, sans-serif;``` 

仇벒잺 **Do not use !important in CSS.** <br />

仇벒잺 **Do not use #id for styling.** <br />

游눝 **Include Normalize.css** <br />
https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/  <br />
Normalize.css should be linked before the main style file. 

游눝 **Avoid nesting selectors more than two levels deep.**  <br />

游눝 **Avoid styling tags directly** <br />
except for body, ul, a, img. <br />

游눝 **Colors should be in a consistent format (hex or rgba).** <br />
Color notation is either in hex ```(#000)``` or rgba if there is transparency. <br />
Keywords are not used. <br />

## Additional homework:

1. Complete one of the courses to reinforce the theory:
