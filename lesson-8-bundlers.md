# Homework

**Part 1:Set Up Gulp Build**
1. Copy the necessary Gulp configuration files (`gulpfile.js`, `package.json`, etc.) to your project.
2. Organize your project files:
- Move all images to the `src/images/static` folder.
- Copy the styles from your existing CSS file and place them in `src/styles/style.scss`.

**Part 2: Create HTML Templates Using Nunjucks**
1. Set up the templates folder structure:
- `src/templates/` ‚Üí Main folder for all `.njk` files.
- `src/templates/layouts/` ‚Üí Base structure for pages (`base.njk`).
- `src/templates/pages/` ‚Üí Separate folder for each page (`index.njk`, `about.njk`, etc.).
- `src/templates/partials/` ‚Üí Components (e.g., header, footer, product cards).
- `src/templates/data.json` ‚Üí Store dynamic data (e.g., product lists, user profiles).

2. Implement the Nunjucks templating system:
- Create a base template (`base.njk`) with `{% block %}` sections for content.
- Use `{% extends %}` to inherit the layout structure.
- Include reusable components (header, footer) with `{% include %}`.
- Work with variables and loops (`{% for %}`, `{% if %}`) to generate dynamic content.

## Criteria 

‚ù§Ô∏è **Gulp is used as a build tool**  
   - The project is set up with **Gulp** for automation tasks.  

‚ù§Ô∏è **Public and node_modules folders should not be in the GitHub repository**  
   - The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude **automatically generated build files**.  

‚ù§Ô∏è **The project builds correctly**  
   - After running `npm start` or `npm run dev`, the project should build **without critical errors**.  
   - The final files should be correctly placed in `public/` **without manual intervention**.  
   - The build process **should stop** if critical errors occur.  

‚ù§Ô∏è **No errors (`error`) in the console during the build process**  
   - The console should not show **red error messages (`error`)**.  
   - All dependencies should be installed, and plugins should be correctly configured.  

‚ù§Ô∏è **The project is structured using Nunjucks templates**  
   - **Layouts (`layouts/`)** contain the base structure (`base.njk`).  
   - **Partials (`partials/`)** store reusable components (header, footer, product cards, etc.).  
   - **Text content is moved to `data.json`** for better management of dynamic data.  

üíõ **No warnings (`warning`) in the console during the build process**  
   - The console should not show **yellow warning messages (`warning`)**, such as **package incompatibilities or missing dependencies**.  
   - The code should follow best practices and be validated with linters (`stylelint`, `eslint`, `htmllint`).  

üíõ **Loops, variables, and dynamic data are used in Nunjucks**  
   - **Variables are created** using `{% set %}` or fetched from `data.json`.  
   - **Loops (`{% for %}`)** are used to generate lists of elements (e.g., products, reviews).  
   - **Conditional statements (`{% if %}`)** are used to check for data presence or to display different blocks.
