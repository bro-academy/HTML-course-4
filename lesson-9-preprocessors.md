# Homework

1. **Split your styles into multiple SCSS files**
- One BEM block = one SCSS file
- Use separate files for:
    - variables
    - mixins
    - base styles
    - components
2. **Move repeated values into SCSS variables**
3. **Use SCSS nesting**

## Criteria 

‚ù§Ô∏è **SCSS preprocessor is used** <br />
‚ù§Ô∏è **Styles are split into components** <br />
‚ù§Ô∏è **SCSS variables are used for colors and fonts** <br />
üíõ **Mixins are used where appropriate** <br />
üíõ **No magic numbers (all values are explained or reusable)** <br />
