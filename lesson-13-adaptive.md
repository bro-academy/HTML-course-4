# Homework

Implement a responsive layout for all pages:
1. Homework Homepage<br /> 
Enable horizontal scroll for blocks:
- catalog items
- blog posts
- team members
Ensure the burger menu open and work correctly on mobile devices.
2. Homework Catalog page<br /> 
Ensure the filter panel open and work correctly on mobile devices.
3. Homework Blog post page
4. Homework Contact page

Avoid horizontal scroll on the entire page ‚Äî make sure the layout fits the viewport properly.
Test your layout on different screen sizes and pay close attention to spacing, alignment, and interactions.

## Criteria 

‚ù§Ô∏è **Responsive adaptive layout is implemented.**<br />
All pages should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes. Layouts must reflow and resize content properly without breaking.<br />

‚ù§Ô∏è **No horizontal scroll on the full page.**<br />
The main document (html and body) must not scroll sideways on any screen size. Overflow should be handled inside specific containers if needed.<br />

‚ù§Ô∏è **Burger menu works on mobile.**<br />
The navigation menu must be hidden behind a burger icon on small screens, and it must open/close correctly with a tap.<br />

‚ù§Ô∏è **Filter panel opens correctly on mobile.**<br />
If the page includes a filter section, it must be collapsible and function properly on smaller viewports.<br />

‚ù§Ô∏è **Horizontal scroll is enabled for specific blocks.**<br />
On the homepage, sections indicated in the layout as scrollable (e.g., carousels, cards) should scroll horizontally on mobile only, without affecting the rest of the page.<br />

‚ù§Ô∏è **Breakpoints are well chosen.**<br />
Use media queries that match real device sizes (not arbitrary pixels), and ensure content looks good across popular breakpoints (e.g., 360px, 678px, 1280px).<br />

‚ù§Ô∏è **Consistent spacing and alignment.**<br />
Ensure padding/margins remain visually balanced across viewports. Avoid large gaps or tight overlaps on mobile.<br />

‚ù§Ô∏è **Interactive elements are accessible on mobile.**<br />
Touch targets (buttons, links, toggles) should be large enough to tap easily, and key interactions (menu open/close, scrolling, filters) should feel smooth and intuitive.<br />
