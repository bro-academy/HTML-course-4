# Homework

Take your existing HTML markup (homepage and blogpage). Using the BEM methodology, assign correct classes to blocks, elements, and modifiers.

1. Identify blocks.
  Find independent components in your interface (e.g., a product card, a button, a menu).

2. Identify elements.
  Find subordinate parts of blocks (e.g., the product card title, menu items, or a button icon).

3. Add modifiers.
  If certain blocks or elements have variations (e.g., an active button state or a highlighted card), add modifiers to represent these variations.

Use correct syntax.
  * Block: block.
  * Element: block__element.
  * Modifier: block--modifier 

## Criteria 

‚ù§Ô∏è All independent components are defined as separate blocks. <br /> 
Each block is autonomous and does not depend on others. <br /> 

‚ù§Ô∏è All subordinate parts are correctly defined as elements. <br /> 
All internal parts of a block are properly described using elements (block__element). <br /> 

‚ù§Ô∏è BEM element not used outside of related block <br /> 

‚ù§Ô∏è Modifiers correctly describe states or variations. <br /> 
Modifiers reflect states, sizes, types, or other variations of a block or element. <br /> 

‚ù§Ô∏è Modifiers must not include: <br /> 
* Colors: Instead of `block--red`, use a more abstract name like `block--danger`.
* Numbers: Instead of `block--1`, use descriptive names like `block--first`.
* Tag names: Instead of `block--div`, use meaningful modifiers like `block--highlighted`.

‚ù§Ô∏è Modifiers cannot be used as the only class on a tag. <br /> 
* Bad: `<div class="block--active"></div>`
* Good: `<div class="block block--active"></div>`

‚ù§Ô∏è BEM syntax rules are followed: <br /> 
Correct format is used: `block, block__element, block--modifier`. <br /> 
No errors such as:
  * Nested elements (`block__element__subelement`).
  * Use of global classes (`active` instead of `block--active`).

‚ù§Ô∏è Block, element, and modifier names must be meaningful. <br /> 
Each class should logically explain its purpose:
  * Bad: `block--style1`.
  * Good: `block--disabled`.

‚ù§Ô∏è Classes are named correctly: <br /> 
* No transliteration in class names, attributes, etc.
* Only lowercase letters are used.
* If a class name consists of several words, use hyphens between the words: slider-block, etc.
* Do not use presentational classes that specify styles (fz-15, color-green, block-left).
* The class name should reflect the purpose (semantics) of the block, not its appearance.
